        Each quiz contains questions from five categories: General Knowledge, Computer science, Geography, History and Animals
        and each question can be of easy, medium or hard difficulty. You start with a one minute timer. Giving a correct answer grants extra time, based on the difficulty of the question.
        On the other hand, giving a wrong answer costs you time, the amount of which also depends on the difficulty of the question.
        The time distribution based on question difficulty is as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Easy questions.</b> Correct answers grant one extra second. Wrong answers deduct three seconds.</li>
        <li><b>Medium questions.</b> Correct answers grant two extra seconds. Wrong answers deduct two seconds.</li>
        <li><b>Hard questions.</b> Correct answers grant three extra seconds. Wrong answers deduct one second.</li>
    </ul>
